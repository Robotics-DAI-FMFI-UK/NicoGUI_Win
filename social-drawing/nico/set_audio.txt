the correct audio playback device for NICO is "Speaker (USB 2.0 Device)"
set is via volume control panel as a default

however sometimes speech synthesis is not directly following the setup 
of the default audio playback device.
in that case, go to Settings / Manage Sound Devices
disable the current device used by the speech synthesis
(you can obtain the list of all devices by "wmic sounddev list brief")
call "python speak.py" (from this directory)
and enable the disabled device
